# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads project, a bookshelf app built using *React* with an API server and client library that will use to persist information as users interact with the application.

The [initial starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) contained the static example of the CSS and HTML markup, without any React code. The initial starter template also provided a backend server for this project.

## Instruction

Download project files [here](https://github.com/alramadona/FEWD7-MyReads/archive/master.zip).

* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
